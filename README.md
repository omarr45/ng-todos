# Todos

A simple project to test the [todo](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) API, and to learn how to use [Angular](https://angular.dev/).

There is only one route -the root- and it shows a list of todos.
The user can search for a todo by its title.

The styling is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
